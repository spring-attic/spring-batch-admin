/**
 * A {@link PartitionHandler} that uses {@link MessageChannel} instances to send instructions to remote workers and
 * receive their responses. The {@link MessageChannel} provides a nice abstraction so that the location of the workers
 * and the transport used to communicate with them can be changed at run time. The communication with the remote workers
 * does not need to be transactional or have guaranteed delivery, so a local thread pool based implementation works as
 * well as a remote web service or JMS implementation. If a remote worker fails or doesn't send a reply message, the job
 * will fail and can be restarted to pick up missing messages and processing. The remote workers need access to the
 * Spring Batch {@link JobRepository} so that the shared state across those restarts can be managed centrally.
