Spring Batch Integration
========================

Many users of [Spring Batch][] may encounter requirements that are outside the scope of [Spring Batch][], yet may be efficiently and concisely implemented using [Spring Integration][]. Conversely, [Spring Batch][] users may encounter [Spring Batch][] requirements and need a way to efficiently integrate both frameworks. In this context several patterns and use-cases emerge and *Spring Batch Integration* will address those requirements:

* [Launching Batch Jobs through Messages](#launching-batch-jobs-through-messages)
* [Providing Feedback with Informational Messages](#providing-feedback-with-informational-messages)
* [Externalizing Batch Process Execution](#externalizing-batch-process-execution)

## Namespace Support

As of Spring Batch Integration 1.3, we start providing dedicated XML Namespace support, with the aim to provide an easier configuration experience. In order to activate the namespace, add the following namespace declarations to your Spring XML Application Context file:

```xml
<beans ...
	xmlns:batch-int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration"
	xsi:schemaLocation="...
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration/spring-batch-integration.xsd">
	...
</beans>
```
A fully configured Spring XML Application Context file for Spring Batch Integration may look like the following:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xmlns:int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration"
	xmlns:batch="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch"
	xmlns:batch-int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration"
	xmlns:jdbc="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jdbc"
	xsi:schemaLocation="
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration/spring-batch-integration.xsd
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch/spring-batch.xsd
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/spring-integration.xsd
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/jdbc http://www.springframework.org/schema/jdbc/spring-jdbc.xsd">
	...
</beans>
```

You can also append version numbers to the referenced XSD file such as:

```xml
xsi:schemaLocation="...
	http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration/spring-batch-integration.xsd">
```

However, as a version-less declaration will always use the latest schema, we generally don't recommend appending the version number to the XSD name. Adding a version number, for instance, would create possibly issues when updating the *Spring Batch Integration* dependencies as they may require more recent versions of the XML schema.

## Launching Batch Jobs through Messages

When starting Batch Jobs using the core Spring Batch API you basically have 2 options:

* [CommandLineJobRunner](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/launch/support/CommandLineJobRunner.html)
* Directly invoke *[JobLauncher](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/launch/JobLauncher.html).run()* with the respective parameters

> For more information please also see the [Spring Batch][] reference documentation: [Running a Job](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/reference/html/configureJob.html#runningAJob)

For example, you may want to use the *CommandLineJobRunner* when invoking Batch Jobs using a shell script. Alternatively, you may use the *JobLauncher* directly, for example when using [Spring Batch][] as part of a web application. However, what about more complex use-cases? Maybe you need to poll a remote (S)FTP server to retrieve the data for the Batch Job. Or your application has to support multiple different data sources simultaneously. For example, you may receive data files not only via the web, but also FTP etc. Maybe additional transformation of the input files is needed before invoking [Spring Batch[]. 

Therefore, it would be much more powerful to execute the batch job using [Spring Integration][] and its numerous adapters. For example, you can use a *File Inbound Channel Adapter* to monitor a directory in the file-system and start the Batch Job as soon as the input file arrives. Additionally you can create [Spring Integration][] flows that use multiple different adapters to  easily ingest data for your Batch Jobs from multiple sources simultaneously using configuration only. Implementing all these scenarios with [Spring Integration][] is easy as it allow for an decoupled event-driven execution of the *JobLauncher*.

*Spring Batch Integration* provides the *[JobLaunchingMessageHandler](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch-admin/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/integration/launch/JobLaunchingMessageHandler.html)* that you can use to launch batch jobs. The input for the *JobLaunchingMessageHandler* is provided by a [Spring Integration][] message, which payload is of type *[JobLaunchRequest](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch-admin/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/integration/launch/JobLaunchRequest.html)*. This class is a wrapper around the Job that needs to be launched as well as the [JobParameters](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/JobParameters.html) necessary to launch the Batch job. 

The following image illustrates the typical [Spring Integration][] message flow in order to start a Batch job.

![Alt text](src/reference/images/launch-batch-job.png "Launch Batch Job")

### Transforming a file into a JobLaunchRequest

```java
public class FileMessageToJobRequest {
    private Job job;
    private String fileParameterName;

    public void setFileParameterName(String fileParameterName) {
        this.fileParameterName = fileParameterName;
    }
    public void setJob(Job job) {
        this.job = job;
    }
    
    @Transformer
    public JobLaunchRequest toRequest(Message<File> message) {
        JobParametersBuilder jobParametersBuilder = new JobParametersBuilder();
        jobParametersBuilder.addString(fileParameterName, message.getPayload().getAbsolutePath());
        return new JobLaunchRequest(job, jobParametersBuilder.toJobParameters());
    }
}
```

### The JobExecution Response

When a Batch Job is being executed, a [JobExecution](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/JobExecution.html) instance is returned. This instance can be used to determine the status of an execution. If a *JobExecution* was able to be created successfully, it will always be returned, regardless of whether or not the actual execution was successful.

The exact behavior on how the *JobExecution* instance is returned depends on the provided *TaskExecutor*. If a **synchronous** (single-threaded) *TaskExecutor* implementation is used, the *JobExecution* response is only returned *after* the job completes. When using an **asynchronous** *TaskExecutor*, the *JobExecution* instance is returned immediately. Users can then take the *id* of *JobExecution* instance (*JobExecution#getJobId()*) and query the *JobRepository* for the job's updated status using the [JobExplorer](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/explore/JobExplorer.html). For more information, please refer to the *Spring Batch* reference documentation on [Querying the Repository](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/reference/html/configureJob.html#queryingRepository).

For more information regarding the returned *JobExecution* instance, please see: 

* http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/reference/html/domain.html#domainJobExecution

### Java Bean Configuration

```xml
<batch:job-repository id="jobRepository"/>

<bean id="batchjobExecutor" class="org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.SimpleJobLauncher">
	<property name="jobRepository" ref="jobRepository"/>
</bean>

<int:transformer input-channel="files" output-channel="requests">
	<bean class="com.manning.siia.batch.FileMessageToJobRequest">
		<property name="job" ref="importPayments"/>
		<property name="fileParameterName" value="input.file.name"/>
	</bean>
</int:transformer>

<int:service-activator method="launch" input-channel="requests"
	output-channel="statuses">
	<bean class="org.springframework.batch.integration.launch.JobLaunchingMessageHandler">
		<constructor-arg ref="jobLauncher"/>
	</bean>
</int:service-activator>
```

### XML Namespace Support

As of *Spring Batch Integration 1.3*, dedicated XML namespace for launching *[Spring Batch][]* jobs is available. This allows you to rewrite the above *Service Activator* with:

```xml
<batch-int:job-launching-gateway  request-channel="requestChannel" reply-channel="replyChannel" job-launcher="jobLauncher"/>
```

#### Available Attributes of the Job-Launching Gateway

**id**
Identifies the underlying Spring bean definition, which is an instance of either:

* [EventDrivenConsumer](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/endpoint/EventDrivenConsumer.html) or
* [PollingConsumer](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/endpoint/PollingConsumer.html)

The exact implementation depends on whether the component's input channel is a

* [SubscribableChannel](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/core/SubscribableChannel.html) or
* [PollableChannel](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/core/PollableChannel.html)

**auto-startup**
Boolean flag to indicate that the endpoint should start automatically on startup. The default is *true*.

**request-channel**
The input [MessageChannel](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/MessageChannel.html) of this endpoint.

**reply-channel**
*Message Channel* to which the resulting *[JobExecution](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/JobExecution.html)* payload will be sent.

**reply-timeout**
Allows you to specify how long this gateway will wait for the reply message to be sent successfully to the reply channel before throwing an exception. This attribute only applies when the channel might block, for example when using a bounded queue channel that is currently full.

Also, keep in mind that when sending to a [DirectChannel](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/channel/DirectChannel.html), the invocation will occur in the sender's thread. Therefore, the failing of the send operation may be caused by other components further downstream.

The *reply-timeout* attribute maps to the *sendTimeout* property of the underlying [MessagingTemplate](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/core/MessagingTemplate.html) instance (org.springframework.integration.core.MessagingTemplate). The attribute will default, if not specified, to *-1*, meaning that by default, the Gateway will wait indefinitely. The value is specified in milliseconds.

**job-launcher**
Pass in a custom *[JobLauncher](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/launch/JobLauncher.html)* bean reference. This attribute is optional. If not specified the adapter will re-use the instance that is registered under the id *jobLauncher* (E.g. when using the [@EnableBatchProcessing](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/configuration/annotation/EnableBatchProcessing.html) annotation via JavaConfig). If no default instance exists an exception is thrown.

**order**
Specifies the order for invocation when this endpoint is connected as a subscriber to a [SubscribableChannel](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/core/SubscribableChannel.html).

#### Sub-Elements

When this Gateway is receiving messages from a [PollableChannel](http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/core/PollableChannel.html), you must either provide a global default Poller or provide a Poller sub-element to the 
*Job-Launching Gateway*:

```xml
<batch-int:job-launching-gateway  request-channel="queueChannel" reply-channel="replyChannel" job-launcher="jobLauncher">
	<int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
</batch-int:job-launching-gateway>
```

## Providing Feedback with Informational Messages

As [Spring Batch][] jobs can run for long times, providing progress information will be critical. For example, stake-holders may want to be notified if a Batch Job has failed. [Spring Batch][] provides support for this information being gathered through:

* Active polling or
* Event-driven, using listeners.

When starting a *Spring Batch* job asynchronously, e.g. by using the *Job-Launching Gateway*, a [JobExecution](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/JobExecution.html) instance is returned. Thus, *JobExecution#getJobId* can be used to continuously poll for status updates by retrieving updated instances of the *JobExecution* from the *JobRepository* using the *JobExplorer*. However, this is considered sub-optimal and an event-driven approach should be preferred.

Therefore, [Spring Batch][] provides listeners such as:

* [StepListener](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/StepListener.html)
* [ChunkListener](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/ChunkListener.html)
* [JobExecutionListener](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/JobExecutionListener.html)

In the following example, a *Spring Batch* job was configured with *JobExecutionListener*. Thus, *Spring Integration* will receive and process any Batch job status changes. For example, the received *JobExecution* can be inspected using a *Router*. Job that are deemed recoverable may cause a restart of a Spring Batch job while a successful job completion may be routed to an Mail Outbound Channel Adapter, so that Email notification are sent out. 

![Alt text](src/reference/images/handling-informational-messages.png "Handling Information Messages")

Here is a brief example how a listener is configured: 

```xml
<batch:job id="importPayments">
    ...
    <batch:listeners>
        <batch:listener ref="notificationExecutionsListener"/>
    </batch:listeners>
</batch:job>

<int:gateway id="notificationExecutionsListener"
    service-interface="o.s.batch.core.JobExecutionListener"
    default-request-channel="jobExecutions"/>
```

## Externalizing Batch Process Execution

The two integration approaches discussed so far suggest use-cases where [Spring Integration][] wraps [Spring Batch][] like an outer-shell. However, [Spring Batch][] can also use [Spring Integration][] internally. Using this approach, [Spring Batch][] users can delegate the processing of items or even chunks to outside processes. This allows you to offload complex processing. *Spring Batch Integration* provides dedicated support for:

* Remote Chunking
* Remote Partitioning

### Remote Chunking

![Alt text](src/reference/images/remote-chunking.png "Remote Chunking")

Remote Chunking helps you to to scale the processing of items. In a simple Remote Chunking use-case, an *ItemProcessor* can serve as a messaging gateway deferring the processing of items to [Spring Integration][]. Thus, long running processing, *Spring Batch Integration* provides wrapper components for the *ItemWriter* and *ItemProcessor*:

* [AsyncItemWriter](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/spring-batch-integration/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/integration/async/AsyncItemWriter.html)
* [AsyncItemProcessor](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/spring-batch-integration/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/integration/async/AsyncItemProcessor.html)

Therefore, you can increase performance by using asynchronous item processing, basically allowing you to implement *fork-join* scenarios. The *Gateway* invocations are executed concurrently instead sequentially. The *AsyncItemWriter* will gather the results and write back the chunk as soon as all the results become available.

Taking things one step further, one can also externalize the chunk processing using the *[ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/spring-batch-integration/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/integration/chunk/ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter.html)* which is provided by *Spring Batch Integration*. That way you can send an entire chunk to a Gateway, reducing *Spring Batch*'s responsibilities to read items, group them and send out the chunk. Once sent, *Spring Batch* will continue the process of reading and grouping items, without waiting for the results. Rather it is the responsibility of the *ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter* to gather the results and integrate them back into the [Spring Batch][] process. 

Using *Spring Integration* you have full control over the concurrency of your processes, for instance by using *QueueChannel*s instead of *DirectChannels*. Furthermore, by relying on *Spring Integration*'s rich collection of Channel Adapters (E.g. JMS or AMQP), you can distribute chunks of a Batch job to external systems for processing.

For more information, please also consult the *Spring Batch* manual, specifically the chapter on [Remote Chunking](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/reference/html/scalability.html#remoteChunking).

### Remote Partitioning

![Alt text](src/reference/images/remote-partitioning.png "Remote Chunking")

Remote Partitioning, on the other hand, is useful when the problem is not the processing of items, but the associated I/O represents the bottleneck. Using Remote Partitioning, work can be farmed out to slaves that execute complete [Spring Batch][] steps. Thus, each slave has its own *reader*, *processor* and *writer*. For this purpose, *Spring Batch Integration* provides the [MessageChannelPartitionHandler](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/integration/partition/MessageChannelPartitionHandler.html).

This implementation of the [PartitionHandler](http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/partition/PartitionHandler.html) interface uses *MessageChannel* instances to send instructions to remote workers and receive their responses. This provides a nice abstraction from the transports (E.g. JMS or AMQP) being used to communicate with the remote workers.

For more information, please see:

* http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/reference/html/scalability.html#partitioning
