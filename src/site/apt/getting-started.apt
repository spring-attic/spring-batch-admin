Getting Started with Spring Batch Admin

  Easiest way to get started: deploy the sample.  It's a regular war file.  
  Once it's deployed, browse with a web browser 
  (e.g. localhost:8080/spring-batch-admin-sample) and check out the features for
  launching jobs and inspecting job executions.
  
  Four ways to get the code:
  
  	[[1]] Use the {{{http://www.springsource.com/download/community}SpringSource Community Download}} page.
  
    [[2]] Get the jars from S3 (browse to /maven.springframework.org/snapshot/org/springframework/batch
  	with your favourite S3 tool or a service like {{{http://shrub.appspot.com}the Shrub app}}). 

    [[2]] Check out the source code from
  	{{{https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-batch-admin}Github}}.
  	Github also has .zip downloads of the repository from tagged
  	commits.

    [[3]] Use Maven to download the artifacts by creating a pom with 
  	dependency
  	
+---
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-batch-admin-manager</artifactId>
	<version>1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
+---
 
      For snapshots, add a repository location:
      
+---
<repository>
	<id>spring-snapshots</id>
	<name>Spring Maven Snapshot Repository</name>
	<url>http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/snapshot</url>
</repository>

* Add your Own Job Executions

  Just execute a job (e.g. from command line) against the same database that is
  used by Spring Batch Admin, and the UI picks up the meta data from the 
  usual Spring Batch tables.

* Add your Own Jobs For Launching

  Include Spring XML files in <<<META-INF/spring/batch/jobs>>>.  Each file should be self-contained
  (except for Batch execution components like the <<<jobRepository>>> which are provided
  centrally), and carry one or more bean definitions for a Spring Batch <<<Job>>>.  When
  the application starts these files are scanned and loaded as child contexts, and then 
  the jobs are registered with a <<<JobRegistry>>> in the parent.  Because they are 
  child contexts you don't have to worry about name clashes between different XML files 
  or different contributing JARs (except for the jobs which must have unique names, at 
  present, but perhaps not when we get to a release).  
  
  As a convenience, the child contexts inherit
  property placeholders and AOP configuration from the parent (this is not the default
  behaviour for a child context).  This means you can control those things centrally
  if you need to.  Of course, the child can always create its own placeholder definition and AOP
  configuration, but these will not affect the parent or any of its siblings.

* Environment Settings

  The most likely thing you will want to customize is the location of the database.  
  Spring Batch Admin ships with an embedded HSQLDB database, which is initialized on
  start up.
  
    * To change the database type add a file to the application classpath called 
    <<<batch-[type].properties>>>, where <<<[type]>>> is the database type you want to use.
    Copy the contents of the <<<batch-hsql.properties>>> from the Manager jar and change the values
    to suit your environment.  Then launch the application with a system property 
    <<<-DENVIRONMENT=[type]>>>.
    
    * To stop the database from being 
    wiped and re-created just set <<<batch.data.source.init=false>>>
    (in the properties file or as a System property). 

* Overriding Components from Spring Batch Admin

  The system tries to provide some useful defaults for things like transaction manager,
  job repository, job registry etc.  Most of these live in the manager jar in
  a special place: <<<META-INF/spring/batch/bootstrap>>>.  If you want to
  override them, just add your own versions of the same bean definitions to a
  Spring XML config file in <<<META-INF/spring/batch/override>>> (these are guaranteed to load 
  after the bootstrap files, so they can override default definitions).  You could
  use this to override the data source definition as an alternative to the environment
  settings described above. 

* Create your own Web Application

  Hints for custom applications:
  
    * Look at the sample.
    
    * Create a war project with an index.jsp and a web.xml (from the sample or from 
    the <<<spring-batch-admin-resources.jar>>>).
    
    * Include the <<<spring-batch-admin-*.jar>>> files in <<<WEB-INF/lib>>>.  In the sample this is done simply by 
    making the WAR depend on those jar files in the Maven pom.
    
    * Deploy the web app.
