Spring Batch Admin

* NOTE:  Spring Batch Admin will be moving into the Spring Attic with an end of life
  date to be December 31, 2017. The functionality of Spring Batch Admin has been mostly
  duplicated and expanded upon via
  {{{https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/}Spring Cloud Data Flow}} and we encourage
  all users to migrate to that going forward.  Documentation on that migration process can
  be found in the Spring Batch Admin Github repository
  {{{https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch-admin/blob/master/MIGRATION.md}here}}.

  Spring Batch Admin provides a web-based user interface that features 
  an admin console for {{{https://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/}Spring Batch}}
  applications and systems.  It is an
  open-source project from {{{https://www.spring.io}Spring}}.
  
  Here are some {{{screenshots.html}screenshots of the main use cases}}.
