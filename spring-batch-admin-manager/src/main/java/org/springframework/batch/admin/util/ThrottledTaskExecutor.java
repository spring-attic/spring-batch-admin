 * A throttle limit is provided to limit the number of pending requests over and
 * above the features provided by the other task executors. The submit method
 * blocks until there are results available to retrieve. This limit is different
 * (and orthogonal) to any queue size imposed by the delegate
 * {@link TaskExecutor}: such queues normally do not throttle, in the sense that
 * they always accept more work, until they fill up, at which point they reject.
 * The point of a throttle is to not reject any work, but to still limit the
 * number of concurrent tasks.
